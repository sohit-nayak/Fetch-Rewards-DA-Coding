# Fetch-Rewards-DA-Coding
This is my attempt for solving the Coding Challenge for Fetch Rewards. 

In this challenge, I have acheived the following objectives:
- Normalized `receipts.json`, `users.json` and `brands.json` files and transformed them into DataFrames using pandas library
- Answered a predetermined question from a business stakeholder using mySQL script
- Performed EDA to highlight data quality issues in the data provided
- Communicated data quality issues in a manner understandable by a product/busines leader
